# jazbot-the-second
A bot for playing music using discord.js

The rough idea will be the following - use index.js as the "entry" with the other code dealing with playing the actual music in a seperate .js file. The purpose with making the music player a seperate class will be to allow for us to implement features such as play, stop, etc and also even possibly queuing in the not so distant future! These are all just rough ideas but this is a project that was for learning purposes and out of interest. 

TODO:

- Make the bot actually play music, then worry about the other more demanding parts later.
